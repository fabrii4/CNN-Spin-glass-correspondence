# CNN - Spin-glass correspondence

An investigation of the relation between convolutional neural networks and spin glasses.

See [Neural Network - Spin Glass correspondence.pdf](./Neural%20Network%20-%20Spin%20Glass%20correspondence.pdf) for details.

Preliminary tests for 1 and 2 layers feed-forward networks are available in [1-layer](./1-layer) and [2-layers](./2-layers).

Implementations of the training paradigm (both using simulated annealing and quantum annealing) are available in [cnn](./cnn)
for a small Lenet-like convolutional neural network trainable for classification on the MNIST or FashionMNIST datasets.
